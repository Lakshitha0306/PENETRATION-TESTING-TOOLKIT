🔍 Web Application Vulnerability Scanner

📝 Internship Task 2 – CodTech IT Internship

👩‍💻 Created by: Lakshitha R
🛡 Domain: Cyber Security
📌 Task: Develop a Python-based tool to identify common web vulnerabilities like SQL Injection and XSS


---

📖 About the Project

This project is a simple vulnerability scanner built in Python. It focuses on detecting two major types of web application vulnerabilities:

🐞 SQL Injection (SQLi)

💥 Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)


The tool analyzes HTML forms, injects test payloads, and observes the response to identify potential risks.

✨ Features

🔎 Finds all input forms on a webpage

🧪 Fills and submits forms with test payloads

🚨 Detects SQL Injection and XSS vulnerabilities

⚙ Supports both GET and POST methods
